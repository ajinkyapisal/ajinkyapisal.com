a corner. We sat on it and started talking about some random topics. It was still daylight at that time. We talked about each other’s life and then only about my past life. All this time, time was passing and soon there was no sunlight and it was all dark. Just like my life was back then.

I was about to go into a depressing mode, but some imaginary magician waved his wand over marine drive. In parallel, as he was moving his wand over marine drive, it got lit up with city lights. I think it was his best act. The greatest act that turned marine drive into Queen’s Necklace. That view was not just about Queen’s Necklace, there was other building lights nearby marine drive that also added to the beauty of that view. That made me think about some random stuff. I compared my life with the city lights of marine drive.

City lights are not made of only one color. It would not be beautiful to see if it was made of only one color. So is our life, if we had only good moments in it then would it be a life worth leaving for. City light around marine drive is not constant. There are some brighter and darker spots. So is our life. As Tom Hanks said in the movie Forrest Gump, “Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get”. I believe it is true. In life, you will not always get happy moments, sometimes it will be hard on you but remember there will always be good moments after it. You just have to go on with your life.

When I described this to my friend, I was sure that if she had a gun she would have shot me right there. Haha. So I added a few more lines to make it sound funny. In those beautiful city lights of marine drive, there was this one building and it was brighter than the others. I said, “that building represents Indian marriage hall”. Big fat Indian wedding with lots of lights and decorations. Probably the best time of your life. Brightest lights.

My thinking took a lot of time than I thought it would actually have been. So we started towards our respective home. I left that beautiful view of marine drive with a few interesting thoughts. From that day till this day, I have tried my best to enjoy my life. Having fun. Going out with friends. Drinking beer.

If you have reached till this part then thanks to you. I hope you also enjoy your life and be awesome. Enjoy and remember “Why fear when you have a beer!!!”
